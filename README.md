# Resume-Parser-and-Recommender-system

The project aims to develop a Resume Parser and Recommender system to assist job seekers in efficiently matching their skills and experiences with relevant job opportunities. The system will automate the process of parsing resumes, extracting key information such as skills and experiences, and matching them with job descriptions to recommend the best-matching jobs for each applicant.
